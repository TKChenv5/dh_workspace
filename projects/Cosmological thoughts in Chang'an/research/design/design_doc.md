## Background and Context (the W's)

- During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, through the efforts of Confucian scholars such as Dong Zhongshu（董仲舒）, an official philosophy centered on the "天人感应" was established. This theory closely linked imperial power and social order to the principles governing the cosmos, asserting that human governance must emulate the way of Heaven. Deeply integrated with the then-prevalent Yin-Yang and Five Elements theories, as well as mystical practices, it formed a complex cosmological system that provided sacred legitimacy to imperial rule. This framework materialized abstract cosmic order into tangible human institutions, and the capital, as the political heart and symbolic "center of the world," naturally became the most monumental and crucial physical embodiment of this "modeling human institutions upon celestial patterns"（法天象地） principle.

## Research Puzzles

- Currently, we have obtained a very preliminary map of Chang'an from relevant archaeological reports. Just need more detailed data to create a better map using QGIS.

## Methodology

- To provide a more in-depth cultural interpretation of unique features in Chang'an city, such as its 'Dipper-shaped'（斗城） layout. The goal is to develop an analytical model for understanding the 'symbolic planning' of ancient Chinese capitals, which can also be applied to capitals from other historical periods, such as Tang Dynasty Chang'an.

## Expected Outputs

- A Multi-layered Spatial-Ideological Model
  - 星象层： 宫城布局、地理与特定星官（北斗、紫微垣、天汉）的对应关系。
  - 五行层： 方位（五方）、礼制建筑（明堂、社稷）与五行学说的关联。

## Working hypotheses

- The different sections of Western Han Dynasty's Chang'an were deliberately designed to mirror various cosmic models of the time, such as cosmic model（宇宙模型） and the Five Elements theory（五行理论）. The ultimate goal was to create a "miniature universe on Earth" that would glorify imperial power and standardize the empire's structure.

## Challenges and Risks

- Since current maps lack detailed layouts of Chang'an, it is necessary to recreate the city in QGIS based on historical documents (such as the **西都赋**) along with archaeological reports.
